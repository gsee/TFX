Changes in Version 0.1.1
========================

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS
--------------------------

* There is a print() method for objects of class TFXsession.  When a TFXsession
  object is printed, the username and password are not printed.  A TFXsession
  object is just an environment.  So, you can still view things that are not
  printed by using either ls.str() or as.list() on the TFXsession object.

USER VISIBLE CHANGES
--------------------

* ConnectTrueFX(), Disconnect(), and Reconnect() return the TFXsession object
  _invisibly_.  That is, the TFXsession object is no longer printed when these
  functions are called without assinging the result.

* ConnectTrueFX() will give a more informative error if called with a bad 
  username or password.
