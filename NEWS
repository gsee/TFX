Changes in Version 0.1.1
========================

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS
--------------------------

* There is a print() method for objects of class TFXsession.  When a TFXsession
  object is printed, the username and password are not printed.  A TFXsession
  object is just an environment.  So, you can still view things that are not
  printed by using either ls.str() or as.list() on the TFXsession object.

* There is a vignette in both pdf and html formats.  The vignette is precompiled 
  because the Rmd file used to create it contains a registered username. The pdf 
  version can be viewed with vignette("TFX").  To view the html version, type 
  help(package='TFX', help_type='html'), and click 
  "Overview of user guides and package vignettes" or "browse directory".  It can
  also be viewed with `browseURL(paste0('http://127.0.0.1:', tools:::httpdPort,
                                        '/library/TFX/doc/TFX.html'))

USER VISIBLE CHANGES
--------------------

* ConnectTrueFX(), Disconnect(), and Reconnect() return the TFXsession object
  _invisibly_.  That is, the TFXsession object is no longer printed when these
  functions are called without assinging the result.

* ConnectTrueFX() will give a more informative error if called with a bad 
  username or password.

* ConnectTrueFX() will check to make sure `qualifier` is valid -- can only 
  contain letters and numbers.
