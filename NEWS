Changes in Version 0.1.1
========================

NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS
--------------------------

* There is a print() method for objects of class TFXsession.  When a TFXsession
  object is printed, the username and password are not printed.  A TFXsession
  object is just an environment.  So, you can still view things that are not
  printed by using either ls.str() or as.list() on the TFXsession object.
